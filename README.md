# Code exercises done throughout my third year of Engineering School (Master's Degree)

Most (if not all of them) were done in collaboration with Frédéric Lavner ([page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-lavner/))

Some of it might be in French, I apologise in advance

Everything needed should be on it, but feel free to message me should you have any question ! :)
